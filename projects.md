Here is a curated list of projects I am/have been a part of:

## Course Planner
An application that helps you choose courses in a correct sequence to avoid missing pre-requisite courses.
This project is written in JavaScript using React.js and Node.js. <br>
Planning future semesters can be daunting when you have a lot of options.
But there is a very simple logic that dictates this process, and it does not work well when done manually.
This is why I decided to teach the computer the same process.
Now, all you need to do is enter the courses you wish to take and the pre-requisites for each of them and let the computer take care of the rest for you.

## Popularity on Twitter
A program written in Python that calculates how popular a phrase is on Twitter.<br>
It collects all tweets containing the track word for 5 minutes and calculates a score based on who tweeted them and how many times it has been liked. <br>
The formula for the popularity score is a bit wibbly wobbly and still needs some work. So, it will not give you an absolutely deterministic score. <br>
This program can also analyze a user profile to see what they most commonly tweet about and how frequently they tweet.

## Ruins Escapade
This is a simple dungeon crawler game that I made for my Intro to Computing project. This game is written in C++ using SDL Libraries. <Br>
Ruins Escapade is a straightforward game where the player controls the hero who is trying to find his way back home through a labyrinth. <br>
I made this game in less than a week and it currently has only one level.
I am hoping to add more levels when I get the time.

Watch a demo of the game: [Ruins Escapade - Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56loejYyuwU) <br>

## Project Euler
I recently came across this amazing site with lots of computing problems: [Project Euler](http://www.projecteuler.net/). <br>
Since I've always been a fan of math, I began solving these mathematics problems that not only require high computing power but efficient strategies. <br>
I primarily code my solutions in C++ because it is a powerful and versatile language. But you might find a bit of Python in there.
