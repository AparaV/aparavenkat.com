## Looking Behind at 2019

2019 was an interesting year. Here are some of the highlights:
- I took part in the [Mathematical Competition in Modeling](http://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/){:target="_blank"} again in January 2019. Our team modeled the opioid crisis in Appalachia and our paper was chosen as one of the three outstanding winners.
Here is a [news article](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/2019/05/12/2019-math-contest-modeling-results){:target="_blank"} from CU Boulder's Applied Math department.
- I spent the summer of 2019 in Seattle interning in Microsoft's Edge Experimentation team.
- I also broke my foot in Seattle.
- I started working on my honors thesis. It involves modeling the effects of node covariates on the outcome on interactions between nodes in a complex network.
- I led a recitation group for Critical Encounters, which was a class that reshaped my thinking. The recitation involved discussing personal philosophies with four freshmen for an hour every week.
- I finally got my driver's license.
- I took a few interesting classes in 2019 -- Chaotic Dynamics, Randomized Algorithms, Network Science.
- I stared playing video games again.
- I applied to grad schools ü§û
