Here are a list of tools, books, and other various resources that I've found helpful in life and in school.

## Tools

* **[Todoist](https://www.todoist.com){:target="_blank"}** - This is my to-do list app of choice. I like the integration with Gmail that lets me quickly convert an email into a task and get me to #InboxZero
* **[1Password](https://1password.com){:target="_blank"}** - Reusing passwords is bad. Generating and remembering several passwords is difficult. I was skeptical of password managers but caved in after a month of trying. This is the only tool that I pay to use, but my digital security is worth the $36 per year.
* **[Toggl](https://toggl.com){:target="_blank"}** - A time tracking tool that I tend to use when my schedule gets overwhelming.
* **[Zotero](https://zotero.org){:target="_blank"}** - A reference manager whose full potential I still haven't figured out. Right now, I store interesting papers there (never to be read again).
* **[SelfControl](https://selfcontrolapp.com){:target="_blank"}** - Another *productivity* tool that I use when I'm becoming a slacker-man.
* **Note-taking** - [Notion](https://notion.so){:target="_blank"}, [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Bear](https://bear.app/){:target="_blank"}, [Notability](https://www.gingerlabs.com/){:target="_blank"}, default notes app, and regular paper. It really doesn't matter what you use.

## Courses

* **[Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning){:target="_blank"}** taught by Andrew Ng. This was the course that kickstarted everything back in my first year of undergrad.

## Books

_Disclaimer:_ I am neither an expert nor do I claim expertise in these subjects. These are books I've found useful either in classes or outside.

### Core
I'm assuming you are familiar with calculus, linear algebra, and probability.
* Some textbook on Real Analysis - I have _**Advanced Calculus**_ by Fitzpartick
* _**Introduction to Algorithms**_ by CLRS - For computer scientists
* _**Statistical Inference**_ by Casella & Berger - For statisticians
* _**Networks**_ by Mark Newman - For network scientists

### Other useful textbooks
* _**Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos**_ by Steve Strogatz

### For the uninitiated
* _**The Signal and the Noise**_ by Nate Silver - If you've taken a college-level course on probability, this book will be largely unsurprising.
* _**Weapons of Math Destruction**_ by Cathy O'Neil

### Life
* _**The Enchiridion**_ by Epictetus
* _**Meditations**_ by Marcus Aurelius
